A new C# WPF Mush Client

Still deep in development, the goal is to provide a MU client better integrated with Windows 7/8,
and with updated features to improve the user interface of the Mush Clients. 

Also, this is my first major C# project.

Some Goals:
- Tab interface for opening/closing games
- Multiple user input areas to keep you from having to constantly cut and paste out poses in order to see who is
  online.
- Colorization and symbol usage to identify events (pages by default)
- Command selector to allow for commonly found (and custom set) commands to be readily sent to the game
- Logging in RTF format (possibly with preservation of ANSI)
- Quick connect and game selection in each new tab to make it easier to connect
- Multiple connections to the same world
- More stuff I'm sure.
